# Scratch Addons

Scratch Addons unites various features and themes (called [addons](./src/addons/README.md)) for the Scratch website and project editor, offering them through a user-friendly and customizable browser extension. Our goal is to establish a centralized and constantly updated platform that fosters community development of innovative features and themes for Scratch.
